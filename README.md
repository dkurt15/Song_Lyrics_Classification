# Song_Lyrics_Classification

## General info

In this project, my focus entailed constructing a web-scraper devised to extract music lyrics. Following that, I engaged in preprocessing
the acquired textual data, subsequently training a model capable of predicting the artist based on user-inputted lyrics. To evaluate the 
effectiveness of the model, I gathered song lyrics from both Adele and Shakira, procured from www.lyrics.com. These lyrics were employed 
to train four distinct classifiers: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest.

- Web Scraping
- Regular Expressions
- Parsing HTML
- Bag of Words
