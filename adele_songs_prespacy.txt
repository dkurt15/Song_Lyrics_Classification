i only wanted to have fun learning to fly, learning to run i let my heart decide the way when i was young deep down i must have always known that this would be inevitable to earn my stripes i'd have to pay and bear my soul i know i'm not the only one who regrets the things they've done sometimes i just feel it's only me who can't stand the reflection that they see i wish i could live a little more look up to the sky, not just the floor i feel like my life is flashing by and all i can do is watch and cry i miss the air, i miss my friends i miss my mother, i miss it when life was a party to be thrown but that was a million years ago when i walk around all of the streets where i grew up and found my feet they can't look me in the eye it's like they're scared of me i try to think of things to say like a joke or a memory but they don't recognize me now in the light of day i know i'm not the only one who regrets the things they've done sometimes i just feel it's only me who never became who they thought they'd be i wish i could live a little more look up to the sky, not just the floor i feel like my life is flashing by and all i can do is watch and cry i miss the air, i miss my friends i miss my mother, i miss it when life was a party to be thrown but that was a million years ago a million years ago 
i will leave my heart at the door i won't say a word they've all been said before you know so why don't we just play pretend like we're not scared of what's coming next or scared of having nothing left look, don't get me wrong i know there is no tomorrow all i ask is if this is my last night with you hold me like i'm more than just a friend give me a memory i can use take me by the hand while we do what lovers do it matters how this ends 'cause what if i never love again? i don't need your honesty it's already in your eyes and i'm sure my eyes, they speak for me no one knows me like you do and since you're the only one that matters tell me who do i run to? look, don't get me wrong i know there is no tomorrow all i ask is if this is my last night with you hold me like i'm more than just a friend give me a memory i can use take me by the hand while we do what lovers do it matters how this ends 'cause what if i never love again? let this be our lesson in love let this be the way we remember us i don't wanna be cruel or vicious and i ain't asking for forgiveness all i ask is if this is my last night with you hold me like i'm more than just a friend give me a memory i can use take me by the hand while we do what lovers do it matters how this ends 'cause what if i never love again?

you said i'm stubborn and i never give in i think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening you say i'm selfish, i agree with you on that i think you're giving out in way too much in fact i say we've only known each other a year you say i've known you longer, my dear you like to be so close, i like to be alone i like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor walking with each other think we'll never match at all but we do, but we do, but we do, but we do i thought i knew myself, somehow you know me more i've never known this, never before you're the first to make up whenever we argue i don't know who i'd be if i didn't know you you're so provocative, i'm so conservative you're so adventurous, i'm so very cautious, combining you think we would and we do but we do, but we do, but we do favoritism ain't my thing but in this situation, i'll be glad favoritism ain't my thing but in this situation, i'll be glad to make an exception you said i'm stubborn and i never give in i think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening you say i'm selfish, i agree with you on that i think you're giving out in way too much in fact i say we've only known each other one year you say i've known you longer, my dear you like to be so close, i like to be alone i like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor walking with each other think we'll never match at all but we do 
who wants to be right as rain it's better when something is wrong you get excitement in your bones and everything you do's a game when night comes and your all on your own you can say i chose to be alone who want to be right as rain it's harder when your on top 'cause when hard work don't pay off and i'm tired there ain't no room in my bed as far as i'm concerned so wipe that dirty smile off we won't be making up i've cried my heart out and now i've had enough of love who wants to be riding high when you'll just crumble back on down you give up everything you are and even then you don't get far they make believe that everything is exactly what it seems but at least when your at your worst you know how to feel things see when hard work don't pay off and i'm tired there ain't no room in my bed as far as i'm concerned so wipe that dirty smile off we won't be making up i've cried my heart out and now i've had enough of love go ahead and still my heart to make me cry again 'cause it will never hurt as much as it did then when we were both right and no one had blame but now i give up on this endless game 'cause who wants to be right as rain it's better when something is wrong i get excitement in your bones even thought everything's a strain when night comes and i'm all on my own you should know i chose to be alone so who want to be right as rain it's harder when your on top 'cause when hard work don't pay off and i'm tired there ain't no room in my bed as far as i'm concerned so wipe that dirty smile off we won't be making up i've cried my heart out and now i've had enough of love 
i've made up my mind don't need to think it over if i'm wrong i am right don't need to look no further this ain't lust i know this is love but if i tell the world i'll never say enough cause it was not said to you and that's exactly what i need to do if i'm in love with you should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements? even if it leads nowhere or would it be a waste? even if i knew my place should i leave it there? should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements? even if it leads nowhere i'd build myself up and fly around in circles waiting as my heart drops and my back begins to tingle finally could this be it or should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements? even if it leads nowhere or would it be a waste? even if i knew my place should i leave it there? should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements? even if it leads nowhere yeah should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements? even if, it leads nowhere or would it be a waste? even if i knew my place should i leave it there? should i give up, or should i just keep on chasing pavements? should i just keep on chasing pavements? or should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements? even if it leads nowhere or would it be a waste? even if i knew my place should i leave it there? should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements? even if it leads nowhere

i only wanted to have fun learning to fly, learning to run i let my heart decide the way when i was young deep down i must have always known that this would be inevitable to earn my stripes i'd have to pay and bear my soul i know i'm not the only one who regrets the things they've done sometimes i just feel it's only me who can't stand the reflection that they see i wish i could live a little more look up to the sky, not just the floor i feel like my life is flashing by and all i can do is watch and cry i miss the air, i miss my friends i miss my mother, i miss it when life was a party to be thrown but that was a million years ago when i walk around all of the streets where i grew up and found my feet they can't look me in the eye it's like they're scared of me i try to think of things to say like a joke or a memory but they don't recognize me now in the light of day i know i'm not the only one who regrets the things they've done sometimes i just feel it's only me who never became who they thought they'd be i wish i could live a little more look up to the sky, not just the floor i feel like my life is flashing by and all i can do is watch and cry i miss the air, i miss my friends i miss my mother, i miss it when life was a party to be thrown but that was a million years ago a million years ago 
i will leave my heart at the door i won't say a word they've all been said before you know so why don't we just play pretend like we're not scared of what's coming next or scared of having nothing left look, don't get me wrong i know there is no tomorrow all i ask is if this is my last night with you hold me like i'm more than just a friend give me a memory i can use take me by the hand while we do what lovers do it matters how this ends 'cause what if i never love again? i don't need your honesty it's already in your eyes and i'm sure my eyes, they speak for me no one knows me like you do and since you're the only one that matters tell me who do i run to? look, don't get me wrong i know there is no tomorrow all i ask is if this is my last night with you hold me like i'm more than just a friend give me a memory i can use take me by the hand while we do what lovers do it matters how this ends 'cause what if i never love again? let this be our lesson in love let this be the way we remember us i don't wanna be cruel or vicious and i ain't asking for forgiveness all i ask is if this is my last night with you hold me like i'm more than just a friend give me a memory i can use take me by the hand while we do what lovers do it matters how this ends 'cause what if i never love again?

you said i'm stubborn and i never give in i think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening you say i'm selfish, i agree with you on that i think you're giving out in way too much in fact i say we've only known each other a year you say i've known you longer, my dear you like to be so close, i like to be alone i like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor walking with each other think we'll never match at all but we do, but we do, but we do, but we do i thought i knew myself, somehow you know me more i've never known this, never before you're the first to make up whenever we argue i don't know who i'd be if i didn't know you you're so provocative, i'm so conservative you're so adventurous, i'm so very cautious, combining you think we would and we do but we do, but we do, but we do favoritism ain't my thing but in this situation, i'll be glad favoritism ain't my thing but in this situation, i'll be glad to make an exception you said i'm stubborn and i never give in i think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening you say i'm selfish, i agree with you on that i think you're giving out in way too much in fact i say we've only known each other one year you say i've known you longer, my dear you like to be so close, i like to be alone i like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor walking with each other think we'll never match at all but we do 
who wants to be right as rain it's better when something is wrong you get excitement in your bones and everything you do's a game when night comes and your all on your own you can say i chose to be alone who want to be right as rain it's harder when your on top 'cause when hard work don't pay off and i'm tired there ain't no room in my bed as far as i'm concerned so wipe that dirty smile off we won't be making up i've cried my heart out and now i've had enough of love who wants to be riding high when you'll just crumble back on down you give up everything you are and even then you don't get far they make believe that everything is exactly what it seems but at least when your at your worst you know how to feel things see when hard work don't pay off and i'm tired there ain't no room in my bed as far as i'm concerned so wipe that dirty smile off we won't be making up i've cried my heart out and now i've had enough of love go ahead and still my heart to make me cry again 'cause it will never hurt as much as it did then when we were both right and no one had blame but now i give up on this endless game 'cause who wants to be right as rain it's better when something is wrong i get excitement in your bones even thought everything's a strain when night comes and i'm all on my own you should know i chose to be alone so who want to be right as rain it's harder when your on top 'cause when hard work don't pay off and i'm tired there ain't no room in my bed as far as i'm concerned so wipe that dirty smile off we won't be making up i've cried my heart out and now i've had enough of love 
i've made up my mind don't need to think it over if i'm wrong i am right don't need to look no further this ain't lust i know this is love but if i tell the world i'll never say enough cause it was not said to you and that's exactly what i need to do if i'm in love with you should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements? even if it leads nowhere or would it be a waste? even if i knew my place should i leave it there? should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements? even if it leads nowhere i'd build myself up and fly around in circles waiting as my heart drops and my back begins to tingle finally could this be it or should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements? even if it leads nowhere or would it be a waste? even if i knew my place should i leave it there? should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements? even if it leads nowhere yeah should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements? even if, it leads nowhere or would it be a waste? even if i knew my place should i leave it there? should i give up, or should i just keep on chasing pavements? should i just keep on chasing pavements? or should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements? even if it leads nowhere or would it be a waste? even if i knew my place should i leave it there? should i give up or should i just keep chasing pavements? even if it leads nowhere
